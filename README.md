Feel free to commit, but keep a few things in mind - this is an artisitic work, and if I don't happen to like the way you've done something, I reserve the right to deny pull requests. Sorry, that's just how it is.

Also keep in mind that if you commit, and if I accept, you will be credited, but you **may not** post it as your own unless you have contributed more than 50% of the work in the pack.

Mostly though, this is to showcase my method and history of development, hopefully to help someone else someday.

You ***are*** free to use any included* scripts *in any way you like.
Having said that though, I developed them in conjunction with the textures, meaning they are not a toolbox in themselves, but may be adapted to new images fairly easily.

Also, documentation could be better - I may eventaully clean things up.
