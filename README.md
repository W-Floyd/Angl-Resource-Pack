##An open-source vector based Minecraft resource pack.

This is to showcase my method and history of development, hopefully to help someone else someday.

**It is not a free liscence to steal my work.***

Open source doesn't mean you can do whatever you want with it. Follow common etiquette - this is my work, don't steal. Or 'borrow'.

You ***are*** free to use any included *scripts* in any way you like.
Having said that, I developed them in conjunction with the textures, meaning they are not a toolbox in themselves, but may be adapted to new images fairly easily.

Also, documentation could be better - I may eventaully clean things up.
