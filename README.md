# Angl-Resource-Pack
##An open-source vector based Minecraft resource pack.

***

To render and pack in 8px, 16px, 32px, 64px, 128px, 256px and 512px sizes, run

	bash Make-Pack.sh
***

To render a pack in a specific resolution, run

	bash Make-Pack.sh <resolution>
***

To check how a specific texture tiles, run

	bash Tiler.sh <texture name>

Then look in Angl-128px

***

It is recommended, however, to use scripts within the Checks folder.
These will create images of the specified type, and are easier to use.
