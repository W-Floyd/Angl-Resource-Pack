###To-do
####Make packaging scripts again.

This is *only* to showcase my method and history of development, hopefully to help someone else someday.

**It does not give you a right to take credit for my work.**

Open source doesn't mean you can do whatever you want with it. Follow common etiquette - this is my work, don't steal. Or 'borrow'.

You ***are*** free to use any included *scripts* in any way you like.
Having said that, I developed them in conjunction with the textures, meaning they are not a toolbox in themselves, but may be adapted to new images fairly easily.

Also, documentation could be better - I may eventually clean things up.

###Known issues

At one point I had to compile a newer version of Imagemagick from source to make some compositing work. If you get odd results, that may the issue.

Also, last I checked, glass was not transparent in Minecraft. Have yet to verify since redoing the script system.
