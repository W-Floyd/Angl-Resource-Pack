# Angl-Resource-Pack
##An open-source vector based Minecraft resource pack.
### This is a WIP, *many* textures have yet to be added

***

If you just want to download the resource pack, look here: https://github.com/W-Floyd/Angl-Resource-Pack-Export

This is *mostly* to showcase my method and history of development, hopefully to help someone else someday.  

**It does not give you a right to take credit for my work.**

Open source doesn't mean you can do whatever you want with it. Follow common etiquette - this is my work, don't steal (or 'borrow') my textures.  

*However*, I'm more than happy for the rest of my work to be used by other. That includes all the scripts, either as direct drop in replacements, or as bases for other work. The catalogue is also a good base to work from (insomuch as knowing how to fill out fields).

If you wish to add textures, use the included template.svg  

It includes preset grids and canvas size to keep you on track.

You will need https://github.com/W-Floyd/smelt to render (Linux only).  

This is the reference resource pack for my tool smelt. As such, smelt evolves to suite my needs, hopefully in a pack-agnostic way. Until this pack reaches 100% completion, it is entirely likely that smelt will not see a version release. I have a number of plans that will require replacing bits of my script system, none of which I feel should be forced on anyone else.
