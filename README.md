# Angl-Resource-Pack
##An open-source vector based Minecraft resource pack.
### This is a WIP, *many* textures have yet to be added

***

If you just want to download the resource pack, look here: https://github.com/W-Floyd/Angl-Resource-Pack-Export

This is *mostly* to showcase my method and history of development, hopefully to help someone else someday.

**It does not give you a right to take credit for my work.**

Open source doesn't mean you can do whatever you want with it. Follow common etiquette - this is my work, don't steal. Or 'borrow'.

***

If you wish to add textures, use the included template.svg

It includes preset grids and canvas size to keep you on track.

You will need https://github.com/W-Floyd/smelt to render (Linux only, *maybe* OSX).
